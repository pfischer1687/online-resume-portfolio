          <p>Hi! I'm Paul. I love to code everything from websites to computational physics simulations, financial data science, embedded systems in arduino, and more!</p>
          <p>After graduating with a B.S. in Physics with a minor in Applied Mathematics, I taught high school Physics and AP Physics. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge but wanted to return to do more research. During my M.S. in Computational Physics, I really developed my love of coding. My research involved working with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in the C programming language distributed among several nodes of a High Performance Cluster (HPC)  in parallel via Open MPI on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The analysis of my data was done in Python and utilized the libraries pandas, NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib. My love f coding for my research drew me to my current career goals in software engineering.</p>
